# rainmeter-system-monitor
A collection of Rainmeter skins used to monitor a system.

Note: Rainmeter is a Windows only tool.

## How it works
- Everything is inside the Rainmeter framework. Learn more here: https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/
- Some of the skins in this repo use HWInfo. Learn more here: https://www.hwinfo.com/ and here: https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/
- The rest of the skins use native implementations from Rainmeter.
